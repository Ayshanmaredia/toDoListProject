# todolistProject
This project is created using Express.js with Node.js and Deployed live on Heroku server.
Basically I created this project while I was learing an Online course from Udemy which helped me in developing the skills. I divided this project in two parts.
Part one - It was created on local server using Express.js with Node.js and MongoDB.
Part two - After the project was successfully created on local server I further put my data to Database Atlas to store the live data from user and then finally delopyed live using Heroku.
